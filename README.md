# AdminUpdater

The script was created to integrate changes between the two platforms (Podio - Admin (Miinto platform)).
There are 19 different tasks that have been used to update different areas.

All tasks with comments are sent to Google Sheets as information about what has been updated 
and the reason for not updating.
This project is mainly based on the Selenium library.
